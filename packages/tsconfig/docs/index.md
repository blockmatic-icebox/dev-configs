# tsconfig

A collection of different base `tsconfig.json` to be extended from in your project.

This project aims to reduce per-project configuration as much as possible. With good defaults, we can focus on building, not configuration!

## Installation

Add TypeScript to your project:

```sh
yarn add typescript
```

Using npm or yarn:

```sh
yarn add --dev @blockmatic/tsconfig
```

## Examples

See the [examples documentation](./examples.md) for detailed guidance on how to set up the Spotify TypeScript config for your any library or app.

## Getting Started with TypeScript

Step-by-step guides for setting up TypeScript and the Spotify TypeScript config for Golden Path use cases are available in this repo as well.

- [Create React App](./guides/cra.md)

## Getting help

- First, try debugging your config with `tsc --showConfig`.
- Then, ask some folks in the `#typescript` or `#web-languages` slack channels!
